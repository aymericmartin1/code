Hello,
I worked on this proect by doing a small user interface. 
The user imputs his text, chooses the algorithm according to which it is going to be encrypted,
The text is then encrypted, given in encrypted format and then decrypted format to verify encryption and decryption work.
When choosing AES or TripleDES the user is asked to imput a 64 base format Aes or Des key.
For rsa, the key is made for each text through the code. 
I used two random keys for the demonstration.
